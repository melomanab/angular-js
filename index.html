    <h1>Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS</h1>


    <ul>

        <li>
            <h2>Module #1: Introduction to AngularJS</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://melomanab.github.io/angular-js/module1-solution/index.html">
                Lunch checker</a></h3>
            <p>The idea of this assignment is to create a front-end application that presents the user with a textbox
                where they can list comma-separated items they usually eat for lunch. Once that's entered,
                the user has to click the "Check If Too Much" button.
                If the number of items in the textbox is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., 1, 2, or 3), a message should show up
                under to the textbox saying "Enjoy!". If the number of items is greater than 3 (4, 5, and above),
                the message "Too much!" should show up under the textbox.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Module #2: Filters, Digest Cycle, Controller Inheritance, and Custom Services</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://melomanab.github.io/angular-js/module2-solution/index.html">
                Check off shopping list</a></h3>
            <p>A shopping list that allows you to "check off" the items you've already bought, except instead of checking them off, the bought item simply moves to the "Already Bought" list.</p>
        </li>
